    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Corned beef is salt-cured beef. Before electricity paved the way for refrigeration, meat was preserved in salt. Brisket (the tender meat from the lower breast) is traditionally used to make corned beef in the United States.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
        <li>10 small red potatoes</li>
        <li>5 medium carrots</li>
        <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place corned beef in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Add spice packet, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until corned beef is just about fork-tender, about 2 hours. While the corned beef is simmering, cut potatoes in half. Peel carrots and cut into 3-inch pieces. Cut cabbage into small wedges</li>
        <li>When corned beef has cooked for 2 hours, add potatoes and carrots, cook until vegetables are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage and continue to cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove meat and let rest for 15 minutes. Leave broth and vegetables in the Duthc oven. Slice meat across the grain. Serve with vegetables and broth.</li>
    </ol>
